An open source self hosted web app for your notes and bookmarks side by side.

This project is currently in **Beta**. You may encounter bugs or errors.

### Features

- URLs are automatically saved with an image, title and description
- supports both markdown and a rich text editor
- can be installed as a PWA on your mobile devices (and desktop)
- collections can be shared via a public available URL
- links can be pasted (by pressing only one button)
- can be hosted almost anywhere thanks to its use of the lightweight Lumen framework and well supported PHP language

## Installation

**Prerequisite**:
- git  (_https://git-scm.com_)
- composer  (_https://getcomposer.org_)
- PHP â‰¥ 7.2.5
- MySQL, Postgres, SQLite or SQL Server (currently only MySQL is tested)

**Installation**:

- ```git clone https://github.com/fr0tt/benotes```  
(_download files version-controlled_)
- ```composer install```  
(_install dependencies accordingly to your php version. 
<br> Please note that **php8-cli will fail**, use instead something similar to the likes of: ```/usr/bin/php7.4 /usr/local/bin/composer install``` or any other php-cli version between 7.2.5 and 7.4_)
- ```cp .env.example .env```  
(_copy configuration file_)
- generate a random string for ```APP_KEY``` in your ```.env``` file e.g. ```openssl rand -base64 32``` 
(_for security reasons_)
- create a database
- also edit ```DB_DATABASE```, ```DB_USERNAME``` and ```DB_PASSWORD``` in ```.env``` file accordingly. If you use something else than MySQL use most likely need to adjust ```DB_CONNECTION``` and ```DB_PORT``` as well  
(_in order to be able to connect to your database_)
- ```php artisan install```  
(_amongst other: create database tables and fill them. Type yes if asked_)
- ```ln -sfn ../storage/app/public/ public/storage```  
(_create symlink for storage_)
- ```chown -R :www-data storage && chmod -R 774 storage```  
(_make storage directory writable for webserver if your webserver runs as user www-data_)
- if you wish to use it on a production server change in your ```.env``` file ```APP_ENV``` from ```local``` to ```production```
- configure your webserver or use for testing purposes ```php -S localhost:8000 -t public```

**Installation on Heroku**:

- [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/fr0tt/benotes)
- run command: ```php artisan install --only-user``` (_by clicking the 'more' button and 'run console'_)
